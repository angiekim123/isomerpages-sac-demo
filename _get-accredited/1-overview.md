### **What are CABs?**
Conformity Assessment Bodies (CABs) are testing and calibration laboratories, certification bodies as well as inspection bodies that provide conformity assessment services.

After being assessed on their competence, impartiality and performance capability to offer specified conformity assessment services, CABs gain the stamp of international approval through accreditation by the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC). Some of these conformity assessment services include testing, calibration, inspection and certification. Accreditation provides customers and regulatory authorities with added confidence. Certificates that are issued by accredited CABs are more likely to be regarded as having higher credibility.

SAC is a Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) Signatory to various international organisations including ILAC, IAF, APLAC, PAC. The SACâ€™s mark on test, calibration, inspection reports and certificates will mean that the report is recognised among the MRA partners.
