A conformity assessment body (CAB) that is SAC accredited carries one of the SAC accreditation marks. Endorsed reports or accredited certificates carry the SAC mark, along with the accreditation number.

Accreditation is granted for a specific scope of activities, and not for all activities undertaken by the CABs. Therefore, it is important to take note that accredited CABs are only allowed to issue endorsed reports for tests, calibrations/inspections or accredited certificates within the scope of accreditation.
