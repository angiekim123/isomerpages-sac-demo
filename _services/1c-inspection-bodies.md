### **About**
Inspection is the examination of a product design, product service or process/plant. It also involves determining its conformity, either against specific requirements or on the basis of professional judgment. This broad definition indicates that there exists a wide variety of inspection activities. 

### **The Scheme**
The Accreditation Scheme for Inspection Bodies provides official recognition of the integrity and reliability of an inspection body’s services. Achieving effective inspection is important in maintaining the safety of plant machinery, equipment, structures and systems in operation. 

Launched in April 2011, the Accreditation Scheme for Inspection Bodies aims to upgrade the standard of inspection activities to support sound decision-making with regard to safety, health, performance and reliability. 

Accreditation is offered to all inspection services – from one-man operations to in-house manufacturing inspection services to independent inspection bodies. Some areas of inspection include pressure vessels, lifting equipment, motor vehicle,  structural steelwork and site investigation.

Accreditation allows an inspection body to benchmark its work practices against the world’s best practices.

### **Accreditation Criteria**
Inspection bodies are accredited based on the international standard, ISO/IEC 17020 - “General Requirement for the Operation of Various Types of Bodies Performing Inspection”. The Assessment Team comprises a Lead Assessor(s) and Technical Assessor(s). Upon accreditation, the organisation is officially deemed capable of meeting standards of quality, performance, technical competence and professional judgment.

Aside from the international standard, there are also specific technical notes that the inspection body has to comply with, which depends on the area of inspection.

Accreditation for inspection bodies is only granted for a specific scope of inspection activities; only the accredited inspection activities can bear the accreditation mark, thus adding confidence for users.
