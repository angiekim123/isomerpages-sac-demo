Formed in 1996, the Singapore Accreditation Council (SAC) is the national authority for the independent accreditation of conformity assessment bodies in Singapore. Operating under Enterprise Singapore, a statutory board of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, SAC also builds trust in Singapore products and services by strengthening Singapore’s technical infrastructure for conformity assessments and forging mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with our economic partners. SAC’s primary function is to accredit conformity assessment services, such as testing, calibration, inspection and certification.

SAC operates in accordance with relevant international standards and requirements, maintaining integrity and impartiality while taking into account national and public interest. As the designated Singapore representative for accreditation and related conformity assessment activities, SAC works closely with government agencies on MRAs with regional and international bodies to facilitate trade for Singapore.

### **Mission & Strategic Outcomes**

### **Impartiality Policy**
SAC is committed to safeguard and assure the impartiality of its accreditation activities at strategic and operational levels. SAC will not allow commercial, financial and other pressures to compromise impartiality. SAC ensures its committees operate with balanced views and representations from key stakeholders and interested parties without permitting any one interest to predominate or receive favour.
 
### **Financing**
SAC is a not-for-profit establishment. SAC’s main source of revenue is from fees collected from conformity assessment bodies as well as from its training activities. Any deficit of SAC will be funded through Enterprise Singapore.
